      "Remarks": "Pawpaw is strongly recommended as a household tree for all parts of Uganda below 1,500 m. Meat can be tenderized by wrapping it in pawpaw leaves. Harvest fruit when a yellow colour begins to appear. Trees do well for 3-4 years then yield falls, so plant every 4 years on a fresh site. Pawpaw is attacked by several insects. Leaves used to treat whooping cough. ",

      "Description": "A shapely tree to about 10 m, with leafy horizontal branches.", 
      "Ecology": "A tree from Madagascar, now very popular in East Africa, especially Kenya. It has recently been introduced to Uganda and has gained popularity as an ornamental. It has been planted around Parliament buildings and along some streets in Kampala. It grows well in good soil and is drought resistant once estab- lished. Since the tree rarely flowers at high altitudes, seed is collected from trees in hotter low areas.",
